Scenario 1: Test if the batting score is incremented correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_score_increment
  Description: This test verifies if the user's score gets incremented correctly when the user is batting and the run count is different from the opponent's.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_wickets greater than '0', player_choice as '1' to select batting and initialize balls less than '6'. Set player and opponent runs in such a way that they are not equal.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn, passing these initial parameters.
  Assert: Check if the player's score is incremented by the appropriate number of runs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the player's score is updated correctly during the player's batting turn, according to the game's rule that the player scores runs when their choice differs from the opponent's.

Scenario 2: Test player wickets decrease with matching runs
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_wickets_decrement
  Description: This test checks if a wicket is taken from the player when they are batting and their runs match the opponent
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_wickets, player_choice as '1' for batting and initialize balls. Set player_runs and opponent_runs to be the same.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify if the player's wickets decrease by 1.
Validation:
  This is important as it helps ensure the function correctly implements the game rule that the batter loses a wicket when their run count matches the bowler's.

Scenario 3: Test bowling wicket decrement
Details:
  TestName: test_bowling_wickets_decrement
  Description: This test checks if a wicket is taken from the opponent when the player is bowling and their runs match the opponent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_wickets, player_choice as '2' for bowling and initialize balls. Set player_runs and opponent_runs to be the same.
  Act: Invoke function user_turn with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify if the opponent's wickets decrease by 1.
Validation:
  This test is needed to confirm that the function properly applies the game rule that the bowling player earns a wicket when their opponent's runs match their delivery.

Scenario 4: Testing correct increment of balls
Details:
  TestName: test_balls_increment
  Description: Checks if the 'balls' count is being correctly incremented after each turn.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'balls' to 0. 
  Act: After every invocation of the function, count the number of balls.
  Assert: Verify that the count of balls has increased as per the iterations.
Validation:
  This is important to mimic the real world scenario of the game where the number of balls played increases after each turn, signifying progress in the game. 

Scenario 5: Test end of turn on depleting wickets
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_end
  Description: Checks if the turn ends when all wickets have been lost.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_wickets to 0 and pass any value for player_choice.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn with these parameters.
  Assert: The player's turn should immediately come to an end without playing any balls.
Validation:
  This ensures that the function correctly enforces the game rule that the player's turn ends once all their wickets have been taken.
