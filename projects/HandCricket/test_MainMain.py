```
Scenario 1: Testing the toss logic
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_logic
  Description: The test is intended to validate the random toss generation strategy and check whether player choices are reflected correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `random.randint` method so that it returns a fixed value and simulate the user choosing the same value.
  Act: Invoke the `toss()` function with the simulated user input.
  Assert: Verify if the function returns toss winner as 1.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the toss generation and player's choices are happening as expected and contributes to the overall game flow.

Scenario 2: Verification of game scoring logic
Details:
  TestName: test_game_scoring_logic
  Description: The test is intended to verify the scoring logic of the game within a series of overs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `user_turn()` function to return some fixed values. Prepare the environment for a game with fixed number of overs.
  Act: Call the `play_game()` function with these mocked inputs and configurations.
  Assert: Check if the final scores returned match the predetermined scores.
Validation:
  The test validates that the overall scoring logic works correctly and that the correct winner of the game is declared given the scores within a series of overs. 

Scenario 3: Verify the play-game logic when user 1 bats first
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_user1_bat_first
  Description: The test is intended to verify the logic where user 1 has decided to bat first.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Mock `user_turn()` function to return some fixed values. Prepare inputs for player1 choice as 1 (bats first) and player2 choice as 2 (bowls first).
  Act: Invoke `play_game()` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check the game progression by validating the final scores and wickets left.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that the game progresses as expected when the user 1 chooses to bat first, which is important for business logic.

Scenario 4: Validation of catch for ValueError in main()
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_invalid_input
  Description: This test is designed to verify whether the `main()` function correctly handles ValueError when a non-integer value is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the user input by inputting a non-integer value for the number of overs or difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main()` function with the mock inputs.
  Assert: Check whether the function prints "Invalid input, exiting game" as expected.
Validation: 
  This test ensures the robustness of the code by verifying correct value exception handling and is crucial in the scenario where the user could provide invalid input.

Scenario 5: Verify the game result announcement in main()
Details:
  TestName: test_game_result_announcement
  Description: This test is intended to validate the result announcement process and check if the game displays the correct winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock and define inputs for the number of overs, toss winner, and players' choices. Also, mock `play_game()` to produce predetermined scores.
  Act: Invoke `main()` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Validate if `who_won()` is called with correct parameters and the correct winner is displayed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the accurate announcement of game results, which is a major part of the business requirements.
